OnWheels Maps for Wheelchair Users (Beta)
Welcome to OnWheels, a beta version app designed to facilitate the mobility of wheelchair users. This app takes advantage of the wheelchair ramps noted by the community within the city, allowing users to move safely on the sidewalks of the city and avoid obstacles.

About the Project
This project was developed as a thesis for the University of Piraeus, earning a grade of 10/10. The app utilizes GeoHashing to work with millions of Google Maps pings, without reducing its performance on the database (Firebase Realtime Database) and the device.

Features
Accessible map views for wheelchair users
Real-time navigation and route optimization
Community-sourced data on accessible locations
Integration with Google Maps and Firebase Realtime Database
